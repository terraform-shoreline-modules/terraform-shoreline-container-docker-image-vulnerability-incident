### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Docker Image Vulnerability Incident
---

A Docker Image Vulnerability Incident refers to a situation where an issue is discovered with a Docker image that could potentially compromise the security of the system. Docker images are containers that hold all the necessary components and dependencies required to run an application, and if one of these images is found to be vulnerable, it could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system or perform malicious actions. This type of incident typically requires urgent attention and remediation to ensure that the system is secure and protected.

### Parameters
```shell
export IMAGE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_DOCKERFILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export PACKAGE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export NAME_OF_AFFECTED_DOCKER_IMAGE="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check Docker version
```shell
docker version
```

### List all running Docker containers
```shell
docker ps
```

### Check if there are any vulnerabilities in the image
```shell
docker scan ${IMAGE_NAME}
```

### Check if there are any security issues in the Dockerfile
```shell
docker scan --file ${PATH_TO_DOCKERFILE}
```

### Check for any installed packages with known vulnerabilities
```shell
dpkg -l | grep -i ${PACKAGE_NAME}
```

### Check for any installed packages with known vulnerabilities in Alpine Linux
```shell
apk info | grep -i ${PACKAGE_NAME}
```

### Check if there are any vulnerabilities in the operating system
```shell
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## Repair

### Identify the affected Docker images and stop their usage across all systems.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the name of the affected Docker image

IMAGE_NAME=${NAME_OF_AFFECTED_DOCKER_IMAGE}



# Stop all running containers that are using the affected Docker image

docker ps | grep $IMAGE_NAME | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker stop



# Remove all stopped containers that are using the affected Docker image

docker ps -a | grep $IMAGE_NAME | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm -f



# Remove the affected Docker image from the local Docker registry

docker rmi $IMAGE_NAME



# Send a notification that the remediation has been completed

echo "Remediation completed for $IMAGE_NAME"


```
